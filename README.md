<h1> Gradebook Console Application ðŸ“‘ðŸ“šðŸ“• </h1>

This is a C# .Net Console Application that enables the user to enter the student's grades inside the console and consequently,
calculate different statistics associated with the grades. Such as getting the average grade, the letter grade equivalent, and the lowest and highest grade.
The grades are stored in the disk inside a .txt file for future adding of grades to the list, but, it can also be directly deleted
to enter a new set of data.

This application was built as part of the PluralSight C# Fundamentals course to implement OOP principles, as well as understand the
basics of the C# language, such as syntax.
